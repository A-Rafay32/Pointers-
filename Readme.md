This repository is created so that whenever i have trouble understanding pointers or forgot their basic working concepts , i can revise them from here 
I tried to cover all the necessary concepts of pointers in least possible way , will update if i find some other valuable usage of them somewhere 
Firstly , wanted it as a private repository but thought someone might find it convenient for learning or revision purpose( i know that's never gonna happen )
Pro Tip : Pointers makes it so intricasive to comprehend because languages have the same operator, * , for both pointers and dereferencing , and as an amateur , it takes some brain cells to know when one is operating .
To make a distinction , i use * operator close to data types to indicate it as a pointer 
For eg : int* num ;
And * operator with close to variables to indicate the dereferencing
